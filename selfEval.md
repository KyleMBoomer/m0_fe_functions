# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
I'm proud of the fact that I did not intend to get work done today, but decided to crack into it. And now I've been at it for seven hours!
- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?
I can see how functions will alleviate a lot of legwork once I master them, just as keyboard shortcuts do. They present an awful lot of potential for storing and interpreting data, with minimal code written.
